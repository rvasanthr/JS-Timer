# A JavaScript Timer

**Description:**
A crude timer with vanilla JS.

**Goal:**
- Make a fully functional JS timer with animation.

**Status**
- Functional timer with decent animation.

**Future**
- Change the current choppy animation into a much more fluid one.
- Move the timer controls inside the animation item (Circle).
